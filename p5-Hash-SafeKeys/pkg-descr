Every hash variable in Perl has its own internal iterator, accessed by the
builtin each, keys, and values functions. The iterator is also implicitly
used whenever the hash is evaluated in list context. The iterator is "reset"
whenever keys or values is called on a hash, including the implicit calls
when the hash is evaluated in list context. That makes it dangerous to do
certain hash operations inside a while ... each loop.
