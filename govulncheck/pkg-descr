Go's support for vulnerability management includes tooling for analyzing your
codebase and binaries to surface known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
This tooling is backed by the Go vulnerability database, which is curated by
the Go security team. Go's tooling reduces noise in your results by only
surfacing vulnerabilities in functions that your code is actually calling.
