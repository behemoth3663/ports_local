Accepts TCP connections on listen port and forwards them, wrapped in TLS, to
destination port. steady-tun maintains pool of fresh established TLS
connections effectively cancelling delay caused by TLS handshake.

steady-tun may serve as drop-in replacement for stunnel or haproxy for purpose
of secure tunneling of TCP connections. Thus, it is intended for use with
stunnel or haproxy on server side, accepting TLS connections and forwarding
them, for example, to SOCKS proxy. In such configuration make sure your server
timeouts long enough to allow fit lifetime of idle client TLS sessions
(-T option).
