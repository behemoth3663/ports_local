A tool for cleaning up your cloud accounts by nuking (deleting) all resources
within it. cloud-nuke was created for situations when you might have an account
you use for testing and need to clean up leftover resources so you're not
charged for them. Also great for cleaning out accounts with redundant
resources. Also great for removing unnecessary defaults like default VPCs and
permissive ingress/egress rules in default security groups.
