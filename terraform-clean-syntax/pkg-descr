terraform-clean-syntax is a simple command line tool for performing some
small syntax cleanup steps on Terraform .tf configuration files
automatically.

Specifically, it currently knows how to clean up the following:
  - Argument values that are just a single template interpolation, like
    "${foo}", are simplified to the equivalent foo.
  - Variable type constraints using the legacy forms from Terraform 0.11,
    like "string", "list", or "map", are replaced with their modern type
    constraint expressions string, list(string) and map(string).
