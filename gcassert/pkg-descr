Make assertions about compiler decisions in Go programs, via inline comment
directives like //gcassert:inline.

Currently supported directives:

 - //gcassert:inline to assert function callsites are inlined
 - //gcassert:bce to assert bounds checks are eliminated
 - //gcassert:noescape to assert variables don't escape to the heap
