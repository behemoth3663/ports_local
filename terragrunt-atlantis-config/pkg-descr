This tool creates Atlantis YAML configurations for Terragrunt projects by:

 - Finding all terragrunt.hcl in a repo
 - Evaluating their dependency, terraform, locals, and other source blocks to
   find their dependencies
 - Creating a Directed Acyclic Graph of all dependencies
 - Constructing and logging YAML in Atlantis' config spec that reflects the
   graph

This is especially useful for organizations that use monorepos for their
Terragrunt config, and have thousands of lines of config.
