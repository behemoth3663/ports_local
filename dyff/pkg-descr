dyff is a diff tool for YAML files, and sometimes JSON. It is inspired
by the way the old BOSH v1 deployment output presented changes by showing
only the sections of a YAML document that differ between versions.

Differences are referenced using Spruce dot-style syntax or go-patch path
syntax, giving precise and readable context for each change. The output is
designed to be compact, clear, and structurally meaningful, preserving key
order and focusing on semantic differences rather than raw text changes.

dyff can read input from local files, remote URIs, or standard input. It also
supports converting YAML to JSON and vice versa while maintaining
the original ordering of keys. The tool can be used directly or integrated
into workflows such as Kubernetes diffing and other configuration management
tasks.
