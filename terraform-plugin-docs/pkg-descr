terraform-plugin-docs is a documentation generator for Terraform providers.
It extracts structured information from Terraform provider source code and
produces Markdown documentation compatible with the Terraform Registry. The
tool supports resources, data sources, nested blocks, attributes, and other
schema elements, helping provider developers automate and standardize their
documentation.
