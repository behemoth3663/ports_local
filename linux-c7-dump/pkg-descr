The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines files
in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other storage medium.
The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can
restore a full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups
can then be layered on top of the full backup. Single files and
directory subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups.
Install dump if you need a system for both backing up filesystems and
restoring filesystems after backups.
