The hcledit focuses on editing HCL with command line, doesn't aim for generic
query tools. It was originally born for refactoring Terraform configurations,
but it's not limited to specific applications. The HCL specification is
somewhat generic, so usability takes precedence over strictness if there is
room for interpreting meanings in the schemaless approach.
