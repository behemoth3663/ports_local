Rad is a modern, lightweight scripting language and interpreter designed
specifically for creating maintainable and expressive command-line tools.
It provides a clean, Python-like syntax with built-in declarative argument
definitions, automatic help generation, and native support for
JSON processing, HTTP requests, and interactive user prompts. These features
remove the boilerplate typically required in Bash or Python scripts and make
everyday automation tasks significantly simpler.

The language focuses on readability, safety, and a frictionless development
experience. Scripts written in Rad require no external dependencies,
integrate naturally with the shell environment, and come with built-in type
checking and validation. This makes Rad suitable both for quick utilities and
for complex CLI workflows.
