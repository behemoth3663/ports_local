Ktunnel is a CLI tool that establishes a reverse tunnel between a kubernetes
cluster and your local machine. It lets you expose your machine as a service in
the cluster or expose it to a specific deployment. You can also use the client
and server without the orchestration part. Although ktunnel is identified with
kubernetes, it can also be used as a reverse tunnel on any other remote system
