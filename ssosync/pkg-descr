ssosync is a command-line utility developed that synchronizes users and
groups from Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) into AWS IAM Identity Center
(formerly AWS SSO). It enables automated provisioning of identities by
mapping Google groups to AWS permission sets, making it easier to manage
access control across AWS accounts. It is intended to be run periodically or
integrated into identity workflows.
