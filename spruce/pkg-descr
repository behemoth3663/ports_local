spruce is designed to be an intuitive utility for merging YAML/JSON templates
together to generate complicated YAML/JSON config files in a repeatable
fashion. It can be used to stitch together some generic/top level definitions
for the config and pull in overrides for site-specific configurations to DRY
your configs up as much as possible.
