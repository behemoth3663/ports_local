If you use a Kubernetes cluster, chances are very high that you use kubectl a
lot. These are fine tools and allow you to do everything you need to do, but 
there are use cases where you end up with a very long kubectl command in your 
terminal. This is why we created havener to introduce a convenience wrapper 
around kubectl. Think of it as a swiss army knife for Kubernetes tasks. 
Possible use cases are for example executing a command on multiple pods at 
the same time, or retrieving usage details.
