protoc-gen-validate is a protoc plugin to generate polyglot message
validators. While protocol buffers effectively guarantee the types of
structured data, they cannot enforce semantic rules for values. This plugin
adds support to protoc-generated code to validate such constraints.

It is recommended that new and existing projects transition to using
protovalidate - https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate
