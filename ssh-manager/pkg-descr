SSH Key Manager is a command-line tool that simplifies the management of SSH
keys across multiple secret backends such as 1Password, Bitwarden, and AWS
S3. You can securely store, retrieve, and load SSH keys into your local SSH
agent from these providers. It is designed to streamline workflows for
developers and DevOps engineers who use multiple machines or secret
managers.
